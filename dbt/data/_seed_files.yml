    description: | 
      The `cdo_multiplier` here is one factor, used to compute the number of tr_urg students in an external data source, in this case AP exam results data.
      As of 2024, this logic is built into models/reporting_views/ballmer/2+race_urg_multiplier

    description: Overall AP exam results (inclusive of US + non-US schools), derived from aggregate data published annually by the College Board. Pulled as of 5/20/2025. Note that the College Board publishes percentages and we derive the underlying counts, so there are occasionally one-off errors when comparing these numbers to the totals from the College Board. 2009 CSA is excluded due to data errors in the published College Board materials.
