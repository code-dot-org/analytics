### dbt Environment

Welcome to the `cdo-analytics` dbt codebase.
The following models and configurations are used to transform, load, and model data from our application into our data warehouse.

### Using dbt

For starters, you should set-up a local [`dbt-core`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/about-core-setup) install or [`dbt Cloud`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud-setup) environment. 

After you set up dbt, try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
- dbt debug
- dbt deps
