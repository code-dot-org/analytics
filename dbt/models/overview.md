# Code.org Models & Metrics Documentation 
Welcome to all things documentation! We are so glad you're here. 

### Key terms + definitions
#### models   
In trevor, these materialize as tables, but we call them **models** because they do not represent raw data, but rather, are manipulations of data that reflect business context.

#### sources
Source data is where the raw data lies: the data we use to create the models. Generally, you'll never need to look at the documentation of source data, but it could be helpful if you want to trace back where a model's data is coming from. 

### Navigating this site
There are two main ways you can navigate this site: 
1. **Search** for a model: If you are coming to this site with a question about a particular model, you can search for the name of that model and navigate to the associated documentation. 

2. **Explore** different models: If you aren't sure what models are available to you, you can explore the folders and read about the business definitions baked into each model.

In projects, you can navigate to a folder called **models**. Within models, only **released** models will be available for you to view. The data team works with many models and has ongoing prototypes, but only some of them are **released** to the company via trevor.io. When you see a new model released in trevor, its documentation will be added to this site.

### What's available in trevor?
All **models** you see in this documentation site are available to explore in trevor. The **source** tables are generally not available in trevor since there's a high risk for misinterpretation.
