      The data sources in external datasets are largely redshift tables that are direct copies of CSV files stored in S3.
      Code.org's primary external data sources are:

        ## 1. AP Data (from the College Board) 

        Table prefix: `ap_`
        
        AP data includes:
        
        - Aggregated Exam Results
        - School-level Exam Results for Code.org Audit Schools
        - AP Ledgers (lists of schools that are teaching AP CSA and/or AP CS Principles for a given year)
        - AI/NCES Crosswalk (a mapping of College Board AI codes to NCES school ids)

        ## 2. Access Report Data

        Table prefix: `access_report_`
        
        Access report data is composed over a multi-month process.  The final results are loaded here.

        ** NCES school data - as of 2024 this is uploaded as part of the Access Report process through the Engineering Team. It therefore comes in as a source via dashboard_production.  

    tables:

      # aggregate AP exam results
      
      - name: stg_ap_agg_exam_results_raw_2023
        description: "Raw aggregated exam results from 2023. This is more or less a direct copy of data .csv provided by the college board.  See S3 ap_data bucket."

      - name: stg_ap_agg_exam_results_raw_2017_2022
        description: |
          AP aggregated exam results from 2017 to 2022. This is a copy of the existing/old ledger data from the VIEW `dashboard_production.analysis.ap_exam_results_raw` which was dumped into a .csv in S3 ap_data in order to be sourced and loaded consistently with future data. 
          The individual raw files exist in spreadsheets (see College Board Data README), but not in S3.
          Apologies that I don't have the code I used to generate the data, but I'm pretty sure it was just:
          ```sql
          select *
          from analysis.ap_exam_results_raw
          ```

      # school level AP exam results

      # ap ledgers
      - name: stg_ap_ledgers_raw_2017_2021
        description: |
          AP ledgers from 2017 to 2021. This is a copy of the existing/old ledger data from the VIEW `dashboard_production.analysis.ap_exam_results` which was reshaped and filtered slightly and put into a .csv in S3 before being loaded into this table.  
          The raw files exist in spreadsheets, but not in S3."
          Here is the code used to generate it in May, 2024:
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE analysis.stg_ap_ledgers_raw_2017_2021 as (
            SELECT
              exam_year::varchar,
              (exam_year::integer)-1 || '-' || right(exam_year,2) school_year,
              exam,
              ledger_group,
              ai_code,
              name as school_name,
              city,
              state,
              country,
              NULL as provider_syllabus
              
            FROM analysis.ap_ledger_raw
            WHERE exam_year IN (2017,2018,2019,2020,2021)
          );```

        description: |
          AP crosswalk data from 2017 to 2021 with some normalizing and reshaping from the old dashboard_production.analysis.ap_crosswalk_us table.
          Here is the code that generated it:
          ```sql
          CREATE TABLE analysis.stg_ap_crosswalk_2016_2022 AS (
          SELECT
            CASE WHEN left(sch_yr,4) LIKE '20__' THEN left(sch_yr,4) 
            when sch_yr='handmatch' then '2020'
            else '???' end exam_year,
            
            case 
              when substring(sch_yr from 6) = '' then 'CB file'
              when sch_yr='handmatch' then sch_yr
              else substring(sch_yr from 6)
            end as source,
            --sch_yr,
            nces_id,
            ai_code,
            name,
            city,
            state,
            zip 
          FROM analysis.ap_crosswalk_us
          ```
          This data which has been reported out in the past. The raw files exist in spreadsheets, but not in S3."
