      The purpose of this staging table is to:
      
      1. Reshape the (~75-col wide) base tables of aggregate exam results for any/all years into 7 columns.
      2. Union them together.
      3. Normalize the values for e.g. exam, exam/reporting_group, demographic_category, demographic_group, score_category, etc.
      
    columns:
      - name: exam_year
        description: "The year in which the AP exam was taken. i.e. exam_year 2023 means the 2022-23 school year."
      - name: pd_year
        description: "The `pd_year` is here for historical consistency.  If the school year is e.g. 2019-20, then the `pd_year` is 2019 and the `exam_year` is 2020"
      - name: reporting_group
        description: |
          Historically known as **`exam_group`**, the name was changed to disambuguate from demographic groups. 
          The field is the name of the aggregated report we get back from the college board derived from lists of schools we provide to the college board with "tags".  
          The "tags" _are_ the reporting group, however we don't give and get them back with consistent names YoY.  So this field normalized reporting group into consisten YoY labels e.g. `cdo_audit`, `csp_users_and_audit` etc. 
          As of 2024 the set of reporting groups (given by `select distinct reporting_group from stg_external_datasets__ap_agg_exam_results` ) is:
          ```
          2019_AFE

          The category to which the demographic group belongs, such as race or gender. At this staging level the only demographics categories are those we get directly from the college board:

            race
            total

          PLEASE NOTE: **additional demographic categories are added** in downstream models to handle other race/ethnic groupings such as BHNAPI, URG, etc.
