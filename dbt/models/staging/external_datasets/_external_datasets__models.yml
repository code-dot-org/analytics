      The purpose of this staging table is to:
      
      1. Reshape the (~75-col wide) base tables of aggregate exam results for any/all years into 7 columns that form the grain of the table.
      2. Union them together.
      3. Normalize the values for e.g. exam, exam/reporting_group, demographic_category, demographic_group, score_category, etc. (see macros/ap_normalization_macros.sql)
      
    columns:
      - name: exam_year
        description: "The year in which the AP exam was taken. i.e. exam_year 2023 means the 2022-23 school year."

        description: "The `pd_year` is here for historical consistency.  If the school year is e.g. 2019-20, then the `pd_year` is 2019 and the `exam_year` is 2020"
      - name: reporting_group
        description: |
          Historically known as **`exam_group`**, the name was changed to disambuguate from demographic groups. 
          The field is the name of the aggregated report we get back from the college board derived from lists of schools we provide to the college board with "tags".  
          The "tags" _are_ the reporting group, however we don't give and get them back with consistent names YoY.  So this field normalized reporting group into consisten YoY labels e.g. `cdo_audit`, `csp_users_and_audit` etc. 
          As of 2024 the set of reporting groups (given by `select distinct reporting_group from stg_external_datasets__ap_agg_exam_results` ) is:
          ```

  - name: stg_external_datasets__ap_school_level_exam_results
    description: |
      AP school-level exam results staging. This model is VERY similar to `stg_agg_exam_results` except the AP exam score aggregation is happening 
      as the single school-level, rather than groups of schools. 

      The College Board gives us results aggregated at the school level **if the number of students taking the exam at that school is ≥ 10**. 
      
      For all schools with **fewer than 10 students** an aggregate report is created with a **`school_name` like 'LESS THAN 10 AGGREGATE'**.

      The model does the following:
      
      1. Reshapes the (~75 column wide) raw school-level exam results table into a long table, fixing the first 8 columns and pivoting all subsequent columns into key-value pairs: orig_col_name | orig_value.
      2. Unions multiple years of data together.
      3. Renames columns and normalizes the values (see macros/ap_normalization_macros.sql)

      **WHEN onobarding new data please do testing and clean up:**

      a. Look for values with 'UNEXPECTED' – these are new values or encodings in the college board data that should be added to the macros that normalize these values.
      b. Ensure you identify the "less-than-10-aggregate" school record to see how many schools are included in that aggregate. Check that in your resulting data there are records where num_schools equals that number.

      NOTE: The `num_schools` field is produced by a macro that looks for a `school_name like '%LESS THAN 10%=%'` and extracts the number value from the string that appears after the `=` sign. 
      Every other school is assigned `num_schools=1`. If the school name does not conform to that pattern, update the macro to handle the new pattern.
