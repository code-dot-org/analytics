    description: staging model for course_scripts source data
    columns:
    - name: amplitude_id
      description: Amplitude's user id. If Amplitude learns that multiple amplitude_ids actually refer to single user IRL it merges them together, creates a new amplitude_id for the user and back-fills all the data with the new value. (See the table merged_ids_xxxxx for records related to this merging.)
  
    - name: cdo_user_id
      description: Code.org user id. When Amplitude learns that a user has a code.org user id it logs all future events with that ID -- AND it back-fills the code.org user_id into all event records. (see the amplitude_id merge process referenced above)

    - name: event_type
      description: The name of the event as listed in Amplitude.  These have names like "Unit Overview Page Visited By Teacher"

    - name: event_type_short_name
      description: A shortened version of the (sometimes) long event_type value coming from Amplitude. e.g "Unit Overview Page Visited By Teacher" --> "View Unit Page"

    - name: event_time
      description: Timestamp for when the event actually occurred.

    - name: country
      description: Country that Amplitude thinks the user is from.  In metrics, if this user has a cdo_user_id we use the Code.org user_geo mapping for the user over the Amplitude one.
