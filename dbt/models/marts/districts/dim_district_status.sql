{# Notes:
Design: 1 row per school district, school_year, churn_status
Logic: we can determine status based on three properties we can compute for every user|school_year as a binary:
    - 0/1 they are active this school_year - (A)ctive
    - 0/1 they were active in the previous school_year - (P)rev year
    - 0/1 they have ever been active in ANY school_year prior, incl. prev year - (E)ver before

    These 3 values can be combined into an ordered 3-char string representing the concatenated true/false combinations 
    for Active|Prev|Ever e.g. "101" means: ( Active = true AND Prev year = false AND Ever before = true )

    - '000' (0) = 'market'              -- Not active now + never been active
    - '001' (1) = 'inactive churn'      -- NOT active + NOT active prev year + active ever before
    - '010' (2) = '<impossible status>' -- should not be possible, active in the prev year should imply active ever before
    - '011' (3) = 'inactive this year'  -- NOT active + active prev year + (active ever before implied)
    - '100' (4) = 'active new'          -- active this year + NOT active last year + NOT active ever before
    - '101' (5) = 'active reacquired'   -- Active this year + NOT active last year + active in the past
    - '110' (6) = '<impossible status>' -- impossible for same reason as status (2)
    - '111' (7) = 'active retained'     -- active this year + active last year + (active ever before implied)
