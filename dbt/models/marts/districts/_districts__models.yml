      1 row per district, per school_year, with "active" defined by having at least one "active" school (has a teacher with a section of 5+ students completing 1+ levels of the same course). The district's status can thus be defined by one of the following in a given school year--
      ### active new 
      * has never before been "active" until this school year
      ### active retained 
      * was "active" the previous school year and this school year
      ### active reacquired 
      * was "inactive churn" last school year and now "active" this school year.  
      ### inactive this year 
      * was "active" last school year, but not so far this school year. 
      ### inactive churn 
      * was "inactive" last school year and so far this school year. 
      ### market 
      * has never had a school considered "active" on code.org
