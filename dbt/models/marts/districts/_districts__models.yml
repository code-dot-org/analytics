      1 row per district, per school_year, with "active" defined by having at least one "active" school (has a teacher with a section of 5+ students completing 1+ levels of the same course). The district's status can thus be defined by one of the following in a given school year:   
           
      **active new**: has never before been "active" until this school year   
      **active retained**: was "active" the previous school year and this school year   
      **active reacquired**: was "inactive churn" last school year and now "active" this school year     
      **inactive this year**: was "active" last school year, but not so far this school year   
      **inactive churn**: was "inactive" last school year and so far this school year    
      **market**: has never had a school considered "active" on code.org      

      This model also contains information about those **enrolled** in our district program, and the particular school year in which they enrolled. If you see a single district with "enrolled this year" = 1 for multiple school years, this represents a suplicate in the source data, and warrants a fix in data collection.
