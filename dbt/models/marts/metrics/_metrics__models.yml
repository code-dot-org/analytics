  ## Weekly School Acquisitions
  - name: fct_weekly_school_acquisition_metrics
    description: |
      Weekly counts of school acquisitions by status (new, retained, reacquired, inactive, churn, market). These are the top line metrics we use to measure against our goals of active schools.   
         
      **Note**: aggregating across weeks may result in inaccurate counts, as a single school can be considered "retained" multiple weeks in a row, for example, and thus would be double-counted.

School year week 1, starts with July 1 in any given year, and includes however many days there are between July 1 the next closest Sunday. Weeks 2-52 are full Mon-Sun weeks that parallel the ISO week boundaries.  Week 53 is the fragment of the week containing the days from Monday to whatever day June 30 is.
