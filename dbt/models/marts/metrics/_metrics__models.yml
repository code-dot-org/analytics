  - name: fct_weekly_school_acquisition_metrics
    description: |
      Weekly counts of school acquisitions by status (new, retained, reacquired, inactive, churn, market). These are the top line metrics we use to measure against our goals of active schools.   
         
      **Note**: aggregating across weeks may result in inaccurate counts, as a single school can be considered "retained" multiple weeks in a row, for example, and thus would be double-counted.

School year week 1, starts with July 1 in any given year, and includes however many days there are between July 1 the next closest Sunday. Weeks 2-52 are full Mon-Sun weeks that parallel the ISO week boundaries.  Week 53 is the fragment of the week containing the days from Monday to whatever day June 30 is.

      Monthly count of total accounts created, segmented by country and user type (teacher and student).   
      
      **Note**: This only includes accounts that have been signed into at least once (there are cases where teachers can create accounts to pre-populate a section, but no student ever signs in with it).

  # Monthly Signed-In Users
  - name: fct_monthly_signed_in_users
    description: |
      Monthly count of users who signed in, segmented by user type and us/intl
