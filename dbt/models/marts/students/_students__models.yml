  - name: dim_active_students
    description: |
      This model serves as a **prototype** for the active student metric. (Please update this description as the metric is improved/modified.) 

      The model aggregates student activities _per user, per day_ across**:
        - `user_levels`
        - `sign-ins` 
        - `projects`  

      ** the timestamps used for `user_level` and `projects` are the created_at timestamps right now. A better approach (in theory) would be to
      use updated_at, but we would need to start logging those daily.

    columns:
      - name: activity_date
        description: "The date on which activity was recorded for the user, merged across all aggregated activity types."
