      This model serves as a **prototype** for the active student metric. (Please update this description as the metric is improved/modified.) 

      The model aggregates student activities _per user, per day_ across**:
        - `user_levels`
        - `sign-ins` 
        - `projects`  

      ** the timestamps used for `user_level` and `projects` are the created_at timestamps right now. A better approach (in theory) would be to
      use updated_at, but we would need to start logging those daily.

    columns:
      - name: activity_date
        description: "The date on which activity was recorded for the user, merged across all aggregated activity types."

        description: "A 3-character long string 'encoded' to represent the three possible types of activity present for the user on the given day: 'S' for sign-ins, 'L' for user levels, 'P' for projects, in that order; '_' represents absence of the respective activity. For example: `SL_` means that on this day the user has user_level activity and a sign-in record, but no project created. `__P` means only a project was created on this day for this user.  This field reflects in a single sring the 0|1 values from the `has_[event]_activity` fields."
