  - name: dim_active_students
    description: |
      This model serves as a **prototype** for the active student metric. (Please update this description as the metric is improved/modified.) 
      
      The model aggregates student activities _per user, per day_ across**:
        - `user_levels`
        - `sign-ins` 
        - `projects`  
      
      ** the timestamps used for `user_level` and `projects` are the created_at timestamps right now. A better approach (in theory) would be to
      use updated_at, but we would need to start logging those daily.

    columns:
      - name: activity_at_merged
        description: "The date on which activity was recorded for the user, merged accross all aggregated activity types"
        data_type: "date"

      - name: user_id_merged

        data_type: "integer"

      - name: has_user_level_activity
        description: "`0|1` flag indicating whether there was any user level activity for the user on the given day (1 for yes, 0 for no)."

      - name: activity_type
        description: "A string 'encoded' to represent the 3 `0|1` flags, indicating in a single string, the types of activity present for the user on the given day: 'L' for user levels, 'P' for projects, and 'S' for sign-ins, in that order. Each letter represents presence, and '_' represents absence of the respective activity. For example: `L_S` means that on this day the user has user_level activity and a sign-in record, but no project created. `_P_` means only a project was created on this day for this user."
