      1 row per school, per school_year, with "active" defined by having a techer with a section of 5+ students completing 1+ levels of the same course. The school's status can thus be defined by one of the following in a given school year:   
           
      **active new**: has never before been "active" until this school year   
      **active retained**: was "active" the previous school year and this school year   
      **active reacquired**: was "inactive churn" last school year and now "active" this school year    
      **inactive this year**: was "active" last school year, but not so far this school year    
      **inactive churn**: was "inactive" last school year and so far this school year   
      **market**: has never been considered "active" on code.org
