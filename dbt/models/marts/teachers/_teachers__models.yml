      A historical record of all teacher-school associations by school year.   
      
      If the teacher changed schools mid-year, this model takes their school from the end of the year. If there is a date entered for "ended_at", that particular teacher changed schools.

      **Not yet released**   

      This model is a comprehensive view of daily teacher activities that roll into the 'active teacher' metric. 

      A teacher is 'active' on a day if they sign-in or perform any one of the set of core teacher actions that we capture via Amplitude.
      (for more details see - placeholder for doc - or the RED team).
      
      The model merges platform sign-in data with event data from Amplitude. For both sign-ins and various event interactions
      captured via Amplitude, it captures both occurrence of these events (multiple events aggregated to a day), as well 
      as geographical and user type information. Amplitude data can be joined to platform data via a Code.org user_id which 
      Amplitude tracks once it learns that a user is a Code.org user. 
      
      In cases where we have data about a user from both Amplitude and Code.org, for example which country the user is from, we merge
      it together giving preference to the Code.org version of that data.

          Code.org sign-in is listed as `cdo_sign_in`.
          Amplitude events have had their names shortened according to the following
          - '[Amplitude event name]' --> '[shortened version]'

    description: |
      1 row per teacher, per school_year, with "active" defined by having a section of 5+ students completing 1+ levels of the same course. The teacher's status can thus be defined by one of the following in a given school year:   
      
      **active new**: has never before been "active" until this school year   
      **active retained**: was "active" the previous school year and this school year   
      **active reacquired**: was "inactive churn" last school year and now "active" this school year   
      **inactive this year**: was "active" last school year, but not so far this school year    
      **inactive churn**: was "inactive" last school year and so far this school year    
      **market**: has a code.org account, but has never been considered "active"
