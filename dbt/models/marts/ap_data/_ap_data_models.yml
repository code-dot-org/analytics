      This model generates a summary of school-level AP exam results.      
      Specifically, it calculates **for each** grouping of: (exam_year | ai_code | exam | demographic_category | demographic_group ) the number of students:
      1. taking the exam
      2. passing the exam (score of 3, 4, or 5)
      3. the pass rate percentage of that (passing/taking)

      This model is VERY similar to `ap_agg_exam_results_summary` except:
        1. the AP exam score aggregation is happening at the single school-level**, rather than groups of schools.
        2. it does not calculate the additional demographic groups (eg. bhnapi, tr_urg, urg, etc.) that is done for the agg_exam_results.
        3. it excludes several fields of school-level data (see: `stg_ap_school_level_exam_results`) in order to conform to a similar structure as the other ap_agg_exam_results table.

      ** **IMPORTANT NOTE** - Schools with fewer than 10 students
      - The College Board gives us results aggregated at the school level **if the number of students taking the exam at that school is â‰¥ 10**. 
      - For all schools with **fewer than 10 students** an aggregate report is created with a **`school_name` like "LESS THAN 10 AGGREGATE**.

      - name: reporting_group
        description: |
          Historically known as **`exam_group`**, the name was changed to disambuguate from demographic groups. 
          The field is the name of the aggregated report we get back from the college board derived from lists of schools we provide to the college board with "tags".  
          The "tags" _are_ the reporting group, however we don't give and get them back with consistent names YoY.  So this field normalized reporting group into consisten YoY labels e.g. `cdo_audit`, `csp_users_and_audit` etc. 
          As of 2024 the set of reporting groups (given by `select distinct reporting_group from stg_external_datasets__ap_agg_exam_results` ) is:
          ```

            Four straight from the college board:

      The AP School Ledgers provided by the college board show for any given year the set of 1. National and 2. Code.org Audit schools who declared they are teaching either AP Computer Science A or AP Computer Science Principles.


      We effectively get four (4) sets of ledgers each year:
        1. National - Computer Science Principles
        2. National - Computer Science A
        3. Code.org "Audit" - Computer Science Principles
        4. Code.org "Audit" - Computer Science A
        
      This model consolidates all AP ledger data, joining it with the existing aicode/nces crosswalk table to include NCES IDs where a mapping is availble.       We use this data for the access report, as well as for analyses related to the types of schools doing AP computer science.
