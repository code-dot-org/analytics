    description: |
      This model contains the formatted survey responses for all simple foorm surveys (e.g. nps, end of year teacher surveys, self-paced pl surveys).   
      Note: when querying this model, be sure to filter for the form_name or path you're looking for results from.

      - name: path
        description:  from the url string used for distribution, the segment following 'https://studio.code.org/form/. i.e. in 'https://studio.code.org/form/ai_101_district_leaders_selfpaced_pl_pre_survey' the path would be  'ai_101_district_leaders_selfpaced_pl_pre_survey'.

Therefore, for some surveys this field is null.
